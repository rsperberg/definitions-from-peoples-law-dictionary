The Peopleâ€™s Law Dictionary
by Gerald N. Hill, Kathleen Thompson Hill

Publication date 2002

In the .txt file, linebreaks have been removed except to separate definitions. The .html formatting differs slightly from the print version (such as parts of speech being italicized). Corrections to both files have been made to more accurately represent the original text.

The front matter and the appendices have been removed from this version, as have the quotations sprinkled thoughout the definitions.
